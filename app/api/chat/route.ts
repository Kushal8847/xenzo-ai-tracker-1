I'm currently unable to connect to the advanced AI system, but I can still provide basic analysis based on your data:

**Your Financial Summary**:
â€¢ **Total Spending**: $${totalSpent.toFixed(2)} across ${transactions.length} transactions
â€¢ **Average Transaction**: $${avgTransaction.toFixed(2)}
â€¢ **Active Budgets**: ${budgets.length} budgets
â€¢ **Categories**: ${categories.length} spending categories

**Quick Insights**:
${avgTransaction > 100 ? "â€¢ Your larger transaction amounts suggest planned purchases" : "â€¢ Your frequent smaller transactions indicate daily spending habits"}
${budgets.length > 0 ? "â€¢ You have active budget management in place" : "â€¢ Consider setting up budgets for better financial control"}

**Immediate Recommendations**:
1. Review your top spending categories for optimization opportunities
2. Set up automated savings transfers
3. Monitor budget performance weekly
4. Track spending patterns to identify trends
